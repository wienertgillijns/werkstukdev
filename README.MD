# Development 4: Opdracht Werkstuk

## Short
Podiumaanhuis.be is a new website that offers full video's of theater pieces. It's created very quickly using Webflow, a  very simple website creating platform. Now the organisation wants to recreate the app from scratch, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

One feature is the option to filter the video entries based on genres and audience. Using the JSON fetch the entries, show them on the page, and recreate the filter like it is presented on podiumaanhuis.be.

## Requirements
- Write out your approach in the readme.md file. Do a functional analysis of the existing app. Plan your data, functions and the flow of your app.
- It must work. This is the most important requirement. Don't worry too much about clean code or functional programming in the beginning. Create the app, and iterate.
- Push your iterations to github.
- Try to make your code as functional & pure as possible.
- Try to avoid side effects as much as possible.
- Write tests for at least 2 functions
- Show the result on the webpage
- COMMENTS COMMENTS COMMENTS
